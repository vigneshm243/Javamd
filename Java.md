### Major Features

- Simple - removed pointers, automatic garbage collection, etc
- Object Oriented - Everything is a object. 
    - Basic OOPS 
        - Object - 
        - Class
        - Inheritance
        - Polymorphism
        - Abstraction
        - Encapsulation
- Platform Independent - Java code converted to byte code and can run on any platform. Platform independent because of JVM
- Secured 
    - Implicit
        - No explicit pointers
        - Isolated as it runs inside VM
        - Classloader - Loads classes into JVM dynamically. Seperate local files and network files
        - ByteCode Verifier - Check code fragments for illegal code violating access rights to objects
        - Security manager - What resources a class has access to
    - Explicit 
        - SSL
        - JAAS
        - Cryptography
- Architecure independent - int means 4 bytes in 32 and 64 bit
- Distributed - RMI and EJB, call function from any m/c to internet
- High performance - Compared to interpreted languages
- Multi threaded 
- Dynamic - Dynamic class loading
